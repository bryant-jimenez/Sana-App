[# Project Reflection](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10vC3nPnQF1mC-_m54nrAJQoSIjBpZqMEeZUakr_gSfY/edit?usp=sharing)

Hello and welcome to the Sana prototype! Unfortunately many (or all) of the links regarding the original project are deprecated/no longer accessible due to strictness of the course, but I hope the salvaged team reflection of the project is enough to gain some insight onto what Sana does (or was intended to do). Feel free to reach out with any questions.
